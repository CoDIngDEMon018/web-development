# Landing Page

This folder contains the landing page added to the repository.

Files:
- `landing.html` — landing page (Hero, About, Features, Contact/CTA)
- `landing.css` — styles for the landing page

How to preview locally:

1. Serve the repository folder and open `landing-page/landing.html` in your browser.

Using Python (if installed):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\lenovo\web-development
python -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/landing-page/landing.html
```

Using VS Code Live Server: right-click `landing-page/landing.html` -> "Open with Live Server".

Notes:
- The original feature branch `feature/landing-page` was deleted locally and was not present on the remote.
- I copied the landing page files into this folder and committed them to `main`.
- If you want the root `landing.html` and `assets/landing.css` removed (duplicates), tell me and I'll delete them.

If you want anything changed in the landing page (text, colors, images), tell me what to update.
